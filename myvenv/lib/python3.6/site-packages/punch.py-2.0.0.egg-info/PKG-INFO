        About punch
        -----------
        
        Punch is a configurable version updater, and you can use to automate the
        management of your project's version number.
        
        Punch stores the version of your project in its own file. Each time you
        need to update it, Punch runs through the configured files and replaces
        the old version with the new one. Additionally, Punch may also
        automatically commit the version change on your VCS of choice.
        
        This project has been heavily inspired by
        `bumpversion <https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion>`__, and I want to
        thank Filip Noetzel, the author of that project for his work and the
        inspiring ideas.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Punch is available for both Python 2 and Python 3 through pip. Just
        create a virtual environment and run
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip install punch.py
        
        To start working with Punch you need a configuration file and a version
        file. You may ask Punch to create the two files for you with reasonable
        starting values with the flag ``--init``
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            punch --init
        
        which will create the ``punch_config.py`` and ``punch_version.py`` files
        in the current directory.
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        See the CONTRIBUTING file for detailed information. Please remember that
        this project is actively developed in the ``develop`` branch, so be sure
        to work there if you try to implement new feature of fix bugs.

        History
        =======
        
        2.0.0 (2019-11-21)
        ------------------
        
        * **DEPRECATION** Punch doesn't support `GLOBAL` variables in the `FILES` variable anymore. The values given to fields in the `FILES` section are now simple strings and are not processed through Jinja2 anymore.
        * Initial drop of Python 2.x: the CI process doesn't test Python2.x anymore.
        * Complete review of documentation: the docs have been split in multiple files to make it easier to find information and to understand the program.
        * Initial implementation of automatic documentation from tests. Integration tests can now be parsed to extract examples for the documentation. [See documentation: `Examples from tests`]
        * Named serializers: serializers now can be given a name through a dictionary syntax. With this change it becomes possible to select the serializer to use for the VCS. [See documentation: `Configuration > GLOBALS`]
        * Complex serializers: standard serializers use the same pattern both for the search and for the replace actions. With complex serializers you can define two different patterns, one for each action. [See documentation: `Advanced configuration > Complex serializers`]
        * The configuration of each file managed by Punch can override the global serializers or add new ones. [See documentation: `Configuration > FILES`]
        * Release notes: Punch can be configured to check if a pattern based on the new version is present in the managed files. This makes it simple to check if HISTORY files have been updated without requiring to interrupt the execution of the program and later restore it. [See documentation: `Advanced configuration > Release notes`]
        
        
        1.6.2 (2019-08-22)
        ------------------
        
        * Updating the HISTORY file and considering that it is high time I come up with a solution
